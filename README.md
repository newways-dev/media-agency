## 📖 About

This project was created as a **freelance assignment** where I worked closely with a student to help them complete their educational project. Throughout the development process, I provided guidance, mentorship, and hands-on teaching, helping them learn modern React development practices, TypeScript, and advanced UI/UX techniques while building a study portfolio website.
